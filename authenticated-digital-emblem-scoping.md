# Authenticated digital distinctive emblems and signs

## Background

Under international humanitarian law, parties to armed conflict are obliged to refrain from attacking infrastructure marked with an emblem or distinctive sign, including the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Red Crystal. As conflict now involves cyberattack on digital resources, clear authenticated communication of equivalent digital emblems can facilitate compliance with international humanitarian law and protection of humanitarian resources. Extending digital emblems must be accessible through well-known, consensus mechanisms that are respected, verifiable, and accountable against misuse.

## Program of work

1. Define the requirements for authenticating, distributing and verifying digital emblems and distinctive signs with protection under international humanitarian law for online use cases, including endpoints, individual devices and network resources. Requirements will include: 
* authenticatable by multiple, decentralized sources; 
* covert inspection; 
* extendable and removable; 
* accountable for misuse; 
* resilient and implementable, including in times of conflict.

2. Develop a protocol for authenticating and verifying emblems attached to or indicated for endpoints and network resources.

3. Develop protocol extensions for distributing and communicating emblems, through DNS, ICMP and other potential transports.

4. Describe any additional needs for developing, deploying and monitoring a system in practice, including in conflict.

### Out of scope

* Technical protections against cyberattack 
  * Distinctive emblems and signs are protective because of international humanitarian law and the respect of those symbols. The group will not consider work on defining mechanisms to directly protect against cyberattack.

* Deconfliction
  * Notification or identification of physical resources or locations of people or resources to protect from physical attacks are accomplished through other methods, including physical emblems and deconfliction lines. This group will not design systems for indicating protection against physical or kinetic attack.
