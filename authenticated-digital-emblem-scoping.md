# Authenticated digital distinctive emblems and signs

## Background

During armed conflicts, infrastructure marked with certain distinctive emblems or signs, including the Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal, are given special protections under International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and cannot be attacked under almost all circumstances. As conflicts now involve cyberattacks against digital resources, clear authenticated communication of equivalent digital emblems for digital assets can facilitate compliance with IHL and foster stronger protection of medical and humanitarian resources. Extending digital emblems must be accessible through well-known, consensus mechanisms that are respected, verifiable, and accountable against misuse.

## Program of work

1. Define the requirements for authenticating, distributing, and the digital distinctive emblems and signs under IHL for network endpoints and resources. Requirements will include: 
* authenticatable by multiple, decentralized sources; 
* covert inspection; 
* extendable and removable; 
* accountable for misuse; 
* resilient and implementable, including in times of conflict.

2. Develop a protocol for authenticating and verifying emblems attached to or indicated for network endpoints and resources.

3. Develop protocol extensions for distributing and communicating emblems through existing networking transports that are determined to meet the requirements from Section 1. Work with existing WGs that own the selected transport protocols.

4. Describe any additional needs for developing, deploying, and monitoring a system in practice, including in times of conflict.

### Out of scope

* Technical protections against cyberattack 
  * Distinctive emblems and signs are protective because of international humanitarian law and the respect of those symbols. The group will not consider work on defining mechanisms to directly protect against cyberattack.

* Deconfliction
  * Notification or identification of physical resources or locations of people or resources to protect from physical attacks are accomplished through other methods, including physical emblems and deconfliction lines. This group will not design systems for labeling physical assets or indicating protection against physical or kinetic attack.
